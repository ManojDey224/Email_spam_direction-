Description:

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline for classifying emails as spam or legitimate. It aims to provide a robust and adaptable solution to the ever-evolving challenge of spam email filtering.

Project Highlights:

Machine Learning Techniques: Explore the specific algorithms you've employed (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, etc.) and their rationale. Briefly mention any preprocessing steps or hyperparameter tuning strategies.
Data Preprocessing: Describe how you've handled raw email data, including cleaning, feature extraction, and text representation methods.
Evaluation Metrics: Explain the metrics used to assess your model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), highlighting their importance in this context.
Results and Discussion: Summarize your model's performance, discussing strengths and limitations. Include any insights gained from evaluation or comparisons with other approaches.
Future Work: Suggest potential areas for improvement or expansion of your project, such as exploring additional algorithms, incorporating new features, or addressing specific types of spam.
